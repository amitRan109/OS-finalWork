To run the program follow the steps:
0. download the files
1. open new 2 terminals
2. in the first terminal run the command: make
  and then the command: ./server
  the output is the pid of server.
3. in the second terminal run the command: ./client <server_pid> <sig_type> <sig_count>
  when server_pid is the pid of server that we got in the first terminal, sig_type is the type of signal that can be send, 
  and sig_count is the number of times we want to send the signal.
for example: ./client 2345 2 1000
